Unlock screen

To run it requires the Ionic platform.
1. Have npm installed.
2. Console command to install Ionic:  `npm install -g ionic`
3. Run app in browser: `ionic serve -c`
4. Run app on Android phone: `ionic cordova run android --devices`
4a. Can add `--list` to show available devices just to check if you're phone is detected. Takes a while to build so checking first saves time in case it is building for nothing.
